Dummy - The game.

An idler type of game where a static character shoots at target dummies.

Main mechanics:

    Skills -> Only ONE can be active at a time. When you destroy a target dummie you get XP, that XP goes into the selected skill. They give the character STATS upgrades. (XP Gain, Strength, Attack Speed, etc). They have their own XP system, each skill upgrades when they reach the amount needed, the higher the level, the higher the percentage. New skills are unlocked with GOLD.
    Quests -> Only ONE can be active at a time. They have their own level system, but instead of XP, they are upgraded depending on the level of the particular Skill they refer to. Their job is to reward something to the player every certain amount of time. New quests are unlocked depending on the skill level too. They are related to a certain SKILL, for example, the quest "CONCENTRATION" requires concentration skill to be level 1 to be unlocked.
    Upgrades -> These are bought by the player with gold. Once bought, they stay active for the rest of the gameplay. Their goal is to upgrade anything that does not have to do with the base stats of the player itself, but the stuff that the player interacts with. For example new types of arrows, more target dummies (the game starts with 1 one only), making targets spawn automatically, buying different types of targets, etc). This is the most simple system since they do not depend on any other system to be unlocked or upgraded.
